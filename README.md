# Schedule_App
Through using scheduling apps in various jobs, I have realized that there are not many available that work perfect throughout a variety of trades. This app will make it possible to combine your calendar with an easily organized notes app. Your jobs will all have a file linked that will have notes and images for that specific job. Each of these files will be sharable both within and outside of the application as to be shared with co-workers and customers. As implied, this application will primarily be made for trades workers. Many trades workers do not have access to great and intuitive software and my goal is to change that. Thanks to Flutter this application will be accessible to anyone that has an iPhone or android along with Mac or Windows products.
